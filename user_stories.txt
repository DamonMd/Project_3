general idea:
more personalized trip advisor/yelp for reviews
reviews are filtered on those matching your demographics/interests




user stories
user will be able to sign in with facebook/google plus
user will create a profile(hopefully with most of the info coming from the social network login)
the user can search for a city
the site will link to external apis(yelp, tripadvisor, foursquar, etc)
the user can find reviews based on venue type i.e. restaurant, tourist site, bar, etc
the user can filter based on reviews from profiles matching their profile(age, interests)
