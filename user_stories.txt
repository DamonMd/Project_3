general idea:
more personalized trip advisor/yelp for reviews
reviews are filtered on those matching your demographics/interests which come from
a users facebook or twitter profile




user stories
user will be able to sign in with facebook/twitter
user will create a profile(hopefully with most of the info coming from the social network login)
the user can search for a city and activity aka what they want to do or see
the site will link to external apis(yelp, google maps, twitter, facebook etc)
the user can find reviews based the yelp returns
the results will be displayed on a google map that the user can interact with
the map will have markers that also have a pop up box
the user can filter based on reviews from profiles matching their profile(age, interests)
